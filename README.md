<!-- TOC --> About Project:

- This Project shows a visualization of a times table on a circle.
- The times table is displayed by drawing a line from the start to starting point multiplied by the times table.
- The circle will also change colors randomly each drawing.
- After a drawing the times table is incremented.
- There are working controls to change how quickly a circle is changed, the times table, increment size, and points.


<!-- TOC -->  How to use:

- You should be able to just run from main for this to work. CLick start visualization to begin.
- Once running you can set the controls and then click start visualization on the right.
- There is not yet any clear testing other than changing the variables and printing.
- Enter key must be pushed when a times table or points number is entered to a text box.
- When pressing enter on times table field or the number of points field the game is paused.
- Sometimes the incorrect circle is shown when clicking enter on number of points and is fixed by typing enter again.
